        <b>Formula One</b> (also known as <b>Formula 1</b> or <b>F1</b>) is the highest class of international auto
        racing for single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).
        The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of
        the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name
        refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.[1] A Formula One season consists of a
        series of races, known as Grands Prix (French for 'grand prizes' or 'great prizes'), which take place worldwide
        on purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.

    <p>
        The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships: one
        for drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of
        racing licence issued by the FIA.[2] The races must run on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest
        grade-rating issued by the FIA.[2] Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks, but several
        events take place on city streets.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing (q.v. for pre-1947
        history) of the 1920s and 1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet.
        Formula One was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 after World War II, with the first non-championship races
        taking place that year. The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing
        organizations had laid out rules for a world championship before the war, but due to the suspension of racing
        during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship did not become formalized until 1947. The first world
        championship race took place at Silverstone in the United Kingdom in 1950. A championship for constructors
        followed in 1958. National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s.
        Non-championship Formula One events were held by promoters for many years, but due to the increasing cost of
        competition, the last of these occurred in 1983.[10]

    <h3>Big business</h3>
    <p>
        Beginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is
        widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business it now is.[21][22] When
        Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association
        and during 1978 he became its president. Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and
        negotiated with each individually; however, Ecclestone persuaded the teams to "hunt as a pack" through FOCA.[22]
        He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package, which they could take or leave. In return for the
        package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising.[21]

    <h3>Political disputes</h3>
    <h4>FIA–FOTA dispute</h4>
    <p>
        During the 2009 season of Formula One, the sport was gripped in a governance crisis. The FIA President Max
        Mosley proposed numerous cost-cutting measures for the following season, including an optional budget cap for
        the teams;[42] teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom, adjustable
        front and rear wings and an engine not subject to a rev limiter.[42] The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA)
        believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a 'two-tier' championship,
        and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA. However, talks broke down and FOTA teams announced, with the
        exception of Williams and Force India,[43][44] that 'they had no choice' but to form a breakaway championship
        series.[44]

    <h2>Outside the World Championship</h2>
    <p>
        The terms "Formula One race" and "World Championship race" are now effectively synonymous; since 1984, every
        Formula One race has counted towards an official FIA World Championship, and every World Championship race has
        been held to Formula One regulations.[51] In the earlier history of Formula One, many races took place outside
        the World Championship, and local championships run to Formula One regulations also occurred. These events often
        took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship, and featured local cars and
        drivers as well as those competing in the championship.[10]
