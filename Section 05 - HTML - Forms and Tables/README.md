## Notes:

## Introducing HTML Tables
Tables are structured sets of data made up of rows and columns.  
Can use 5-10 HTML elements to generate a table. LOTS of elements to understand and use correctly.

## TR TD and TH Elements
TR stands for Table Row which is a sinlge row in the table.  
TD stands for Table Data which is a single cell in a table that contains data.    
TH stands for Table Header which is a header name for a column in the table.    
TH and TD tage lie within a TR tag


## Thead Tbody Tfoot Elements
These elements break up our table into logical sections.  
Allows us to break it into sections that contain specific types of data whether that be headings or footers or main information.  
These Elements are used for semantic HTML. Helpful for screenreaders if there are very complex tables on your website.

## Colspan and Rowspan
These two attributes when applied to the td and th elements can cause that specific cell to span across multiple rows OR multiple columns

## Forms
The form element itself is a shell that has no visual impact  
This form is then filled with inputs checkboxes, and buttons, etc...
