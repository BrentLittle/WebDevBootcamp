# Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy Course
Hi! I'm Brent Littlefield and I am beginning my journey to become a Web Developer starting with learning the basics through a Udemy course.  
While working through this course I will also be working on small projects as well at the same time to take what I am learning and implement the topics into something of my own.   
The smaller projects will allow me to take what I have learned and apply it in a totally new way that is seperate from the course.

## Organization
The structure of this course is broken down into many different sections with each having a different focus.   
My github repo will reflects this organizational formatting as it is well planned and is easy to reflect upon if in search of material.  
Each of the README section files will also contain any of my "*written*" notes that I have recorded throuhgout the course.  
  
Each Section will have its own README File that outlines what is covered in that section with topics listed under three main headings:
1. Crucial
    * Topic that needs time to be invested in order to truly comprehend. 
2. Important
    * Topic that does not necessarily have a large learning curve but is still ***very*** important to understand for success.    
3. Nice to Have
    * Not an important topic but still good information to retain as it can be helpful.

## Course Curriculum
These are just some of the many topics covered in the course:
