# Web Developer Bootcamp
Hi! I'm Brent Littlefield and I am beginning my journey to become a Web Developer starting with learning the basics through a Udemy course, as well as working on projects at the same time to take what I am learning and implement it into something of my own. 

## Organization
The structure of this course is broken down into many different sections with each having a different focus.   
My github repo will follow this structure closely as It is well organized.  
Each Section will have its own README File that outlines what is covered in that section with topics listed under three main headings:
1. Crucial
    * Topic that needs time to be invested in order to truly comprehend 
2. Important
    * Topic that does not necessarily have a large learning curve but is still ***very*** important to understand for success    
3. Nice to Have
    * Not an important topic but still good information to retain as it can be helpful 

## Course Curriculum
These are just some of the many topics covered in the course:
