Specificity lets us figure out what style if applied when there is a conflict for a particular element

A measure on how specific a given selector is. the more specific selector wins

ID selector - beats out any number of class selectors
CLASS selector - beats out any number of element selectors


ID > CLASS > ELEMENT



0       0               2
ID      CLASS           ELEMENT
        ATTRIBUTE       PSEUDO ELEMENT
        PSEUDO CLASS


INLINE styles are MORE specific than IDs
They overrule everything


!important ignores Specificity and overweighs everything
