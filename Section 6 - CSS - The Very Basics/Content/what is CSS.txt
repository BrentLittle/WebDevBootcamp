HOW DO WE INCLUDE THESE CSS FILES??

BAD IDEA    - Inline Styles & Style Element
GOOD IDEA   - External Style Sheets   
            - linking .css files to the head of your HTML is the best way to use styles on your website
                <link rel="stylesgeet" href="sheet.css">
                    ^^^^
                        LINK GOES IN THE HEAD OF HTML DOC
