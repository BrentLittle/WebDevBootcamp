    <h1>Bagel</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      A bagel (Yiddish: בײגל‎ beygl; Polish: bajgiel), also historically spelled beigel,[1] is a <a href="#nowhere">bread</a> product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland. It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted
      wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, that is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust,
      with the traditional ones being poppy and sesame seeds. Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are different dough types, such as whole-grain and rye.[2][3]

      The earliest known mention of a boiled-then-baked ring-shaped bread can be found in a 13th-century Arabic cookbook, where they are referred to as ka'ak.[4] Today, bagels are widely associated with Ashkenazi Jews from the 17th century; it was first mentioned
      in 1610 in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.[5] However, bagel-like bread known as obwarzanek was common earlier in Poland as seen in royal family accounts from 1394.[6]

      Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America and Poland, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with alternative ways of making them. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (fresh or frozen, often in many flavors)
      in many major supermarkets in those cities.

      The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing more even cooking and baking of the dough: The hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing easier handling
      and transportation and more appealing seller displays.[7][8]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in The Joys of Yiddish about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the food was given as a gift
      to women in childbirth.[9] However, recent study showed that the bagel could be related to the Arabic ka'ak which possibly made its way to Poland and other parts of Europe through the Mediterranean.[4] There is some evidence that the bagel may have
      been made in Germany before being made in Poland.[5][10]

    <h2>Varieties</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>New York style</h3>
    <p>
      The New York bagel contains malt, is cold-fermented for several days to develop the flavors and enhance the crust, and is boiled in salted water before baking in a standard oven.[28] The resulting bagel has a fluffy interior and a chewy crust. According
      to CNN, Brooklynites believe New York bagels are the best due to the quality of the local water.[29] According to Brooklyn Water Bagels CEO Steven Fassberg, the characteristics of a New York bagel are the result of the recipe formula and preparation
      method.[29]

    <h3>Montreal style</h3>
    <p>
      Different from the New York style, the Montreal-style bagel contains malt and sugar with no salt; it is boiled in honey-sweetened water before baking in a wood-fired oven. It is predominantly of the sesame "white" seeds variety (bagels in Toronto are
      similar to those made in New York in that they are less sweet, generally are coated with poppy seeds and are baked in a standard oven).
