Inline Elements fit in along side other Elements

Block level elements tke up a whole block of space.

DIV Element
    BLOCK ELEMENT
    generic container to hold or group elements together

    Able to style these items all at once
    Div takes up full block across the page but each element inside takes as much as it needs to
    
    <div>
        <a href=""></a>
        <a href=""></a>
    </div>


SPAN Element
    INLINE ELEMENT
    to wrap around a single element we may want to single out to later style with CSS
    
    <p> This word is <span>singled</span> out </p>
