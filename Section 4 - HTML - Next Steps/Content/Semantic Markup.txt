Markup that relates to the content of that element

Instead of just using Divs everywhere we can use elements that better describe the content it is being used to structure

<main>    </main>
<header>  </header>
<section> </section>
<nav>     </nav>
<footer>  </footer>



<main> Element
    - Dominant content of the body of a document
    - Should exclude any content that is repeated across different pages (sidebars, nav copyright, logo, search, etc...)

    <main>
    </main>




<nav> Element
    - Section of a page that provides navigation links to the same document or other documents

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>Home</li>
            <li>About</li>
            <li>Contact</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>




<section> Element
    - a Standalone section that does not have a more specific semantic element to represent it
    
    <section>
        <p>
            Section of my larger Document
        </p>
    </section>




<article> Element
    - a self-contained composition in a document that is intended to be independently distributable or reusable

    <article>
        <h1>Weather forecast for Seattle</h1>
        <article class="day-forecast">
            <h2>03 March 2018</h2>
            <p>Rain.</p>
        </article>
    </article>




<aside> Element
    -  represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.

    <aside>
        <p>The Rough-skinned Newt defends itself with a deadly neurotoxin.</p>
    </aside>




<header> Element
    - represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids.

    <header class="page-header">
        <h1>Cute Puppies Express!</h1>
    </header>




<footer> Element
    -  represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.

    <footer>

    </footer>


<Summary> Element  
    - element specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a <details> element's disclosure box.

    <details>
        <summary>I have keys but no doors. I have space but no room. You can enter but can’t leave. What am I?</summary>
        A keyboard.
    </details>


<Time> Element
    - represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate formats

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>


<Figure> Element
    - represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the (<figcaption>) element.
